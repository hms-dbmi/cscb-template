The *Center for Stem Cell Bioinformatics* is an interdisciplinary collaboration driven by researchers at the 
[Harvard Stem Cell Institute](https://hsci.harvard.edu), the
[HMS Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/about-us), the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/) and the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/).

In 2011, the HSCI recognized the increasing need for bioinformatics capacity to handle the vasts amounts of stem cell genomics data being generated at the Institute. A three-tiered strategy was developed:

* Create a [Stem Cell Commons](http://beta.stemcellcommons.org), an open source environment for sharing, processing and analyzing stem cell data that brings together stem cell data sets with tools for curation, dissemination and analysis
* Develop a [Bioinformatics Core](../consulting) to provide consulting services and grant support 
* Establish a targeted [bioinformatics training program](../training) to develop expertise in the community

Since its establishment, the Center for Stem Cell Bioinformatics has provided dedicated support to over 70 HSCI affiliated laboratories, trained over 110 HSCI researchers, and continues to develop its data sharing platform with over 300 data sets.
