# Consulting Support
{:.no-margin-bottom.med-margin-top}

The [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Bioinformatics Core (HBC)](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu) provides dedicated bioinformatics support and training for HSCI affiliates. 

Services include:

* **Next generation sequence analysis**: From data retrievel, management and storage to experimental design, quality control, analysis and writeup. We follow best practices and re-use public workflows and tools wherever possible, but can also adapt existing methods and develop new solutions where required. 

* **Functional analysis**: We can provide a path from genes to function by delivering extensive functional annotation, prioritizing new markers and developing testable hypotheses for future experiments. We test for functional information using gene set enrichment approaches, provide context by integrating your data with public resources such as GEO and ArrayExpress, and explore the biological interaction space in co-expression and high-throughput interaction data sets using network analysis techniques.

* **Grant and manuscript support**: We can support grant proposals, providing guidance on appropriate methods and letters of support. We can also review manuscripts on short notice.
