##### Kickstarting Bioinformatics Capacity at the HSCI and Beyond

Shannan will give a short talk during this year's [12th Annual HSCI Malkin Retreat](https://hsci.harvard.edu/event/12th-annual-hsci-malkin-retreat-0). Join us on May 16 at Harvard University, Northwest Building, Room B103, 52 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA!
