#### Cloud-based Stem Cell Commons for data management, analysis and visualization

A new version of [Stem Cell Commons](http://www.stemcellcommons.org) is coming soon!  Our team has been hard at work migrating the system to the Amazon Cloud and implementing improved data upload, data management, and collaboration features. The [Refinery](http://refinery-platform.org) based platform is available to try in beta version at [beta.stemcellcommons.org](http://beta.stemcellcommons.org). 

If you are an HSCI member and would like to store your data in the Stem Cell Commons (accessible only to your lab until you decide otherwise), please contact Geoff Nelson at <team@stemcellcommons.org>.
