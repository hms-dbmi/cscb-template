# The Stem Cell Commons
{:.left.no-margin-bottom}

The number of high-throughput sequencing applications is ever-increasing which, along with consistently plummeting costs, has significantly increased the accessibility of this technology. However, progress has comparatively lagged behind in making bioinformatics solutions available to wet lab biologists that allow them to manage and explore their data as straightforwardly as they can now produce it.

Consequently, we have developed the Stem Cell Commons platform for the Harvard Stem Cell Institute to provide non-specialists with solutions for storing data, executing popular analysis workflows (e.g. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq), and visualizing results. 

Our goal is that this platform encourages more stem cell biologists to pursue high-throughput sequencing experiments and particularly enables them to independently explore their data to foster new insights.

All data and tools are open source for the Stem Cell Commons are freely available and can be accessed through our public site:
